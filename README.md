# graph-sampling
Lists up the graph sampling strategy to statistically learn the large scale graph

## DeepWalk 
DeepWalk deploys a truncated random walk to sample node sequences, and uses the skip-gram model to learn the representation of node sequences
- only considers the first-order proximity between nodes.
